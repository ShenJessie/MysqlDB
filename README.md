# MysqlDB
How do I connect to a MySQL Database in python
##Installation/Requirements
**Install via pip**

when `pip` is available,the distribution can be downloaded from Pypi and install in one step
>pip install SQLAlchemy

This command will download the latest **released** version of SQLAlchemy from the [Python Cheese Shop](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy) and install it to your system.
In order to install the latest **prerelease** version, such as `1.0.0b1`,pip requires that the `--pre` flag be used:
>pip install --pre SQLAlchemy

Where above, if the most recent version is a prerelease,it will be installed instead of the latest released version.

**Installing using setup.py**
Otherwise,you can install from the distribution using the `setup.py` script:
>python setup.py install
